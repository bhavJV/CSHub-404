# YUessentials

## Inspiration
When we first started our journey in York, we had difficulties navigating such a huge campus, so we were inspired to create a user-friendly website for newcomers to easily get directions for their needs.

## What it does

The user-friendly website helps new students look for the nearest location for essential on-campus necessities like drinking water, vending machine, and microwaves. It has a built-in interactive map that can be used for detailed directions.

## How we built it

We use Figma to design our UI and HTML and CSS to implement our Website.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced setbacks while writing out Front-end code, especially the Interactive-map, but with team discussion and the organizer's help, we overcame any challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to accomplish new skills by working as a team such as using Figma and Front-end web programming.

## What we learned
We have learned that communication is the key to better project implementation and group discussion can help to solve any problem faster.

## What's next for YUessentials
We will be adding more details descriptions for the floor plans such as images and adding more locations accordingly. We also plan to add new features such as cycling lanes and available paths during winter to our map.
